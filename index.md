## Engineering Experience

**Full-Stack Engineer** @ [SkillsGen](www.skillsgen.com) _(2005 - Present)_ <br>
Ultimately responsible for the development of a web application that keeps track of every aspect of a busy IT training company:
  - Tracks classrooms, bookings, invoices, trainer schedules, learning metrics, marketing and customer relations management
  - Developed with Python, flask, postgreSQL, Bootstrap and Swift (for the app).
  - Backend currently being rewritten in Rust.
  - All accessible through the web and a custom iOS application.

**Training** @ [SkillsGen](www.skillsgen.com) _(2012 - Present)_ <br>
  - SQL
  - App development

## Personal Projects
  - **_waves-filters_** (C / Swift / Metal) <br>
    By displaying the signal in both the time and frequency domains this application intends to give the user an intuition into how a synthesizer actually works and what happens when you change the dials. All audio processing is coded in c and called by the Swift layer which also handles drawing the oscilloscope displays with Metal.

  - **_Subtractive Synthesiser_** (C++ / dear imgui)
    This uses a greatly expanded version of the audio processing code of wave and filters to produce a fully functional subtractive synthesizer, coded entirely in c++ with the dear imgui library as the UI.
    ![SubSynth](https://github.com/SkillsGen/CV/blob/master/subsynth.PNG?raw=true "SubSynth")
  - **_Cryptid_** (C++)
    Cryptid is a fully encrypted chat program written in c++ for maximum compatibility, it supports voice chat with the Opus codec, images and video with the VPX codecs. It is extremely performant has fully featured, windows, linux and macos versions.

  - **_cgrad_** (C)
    This is a single header file library that allows you to build up a mathematical expression as a graph, calculate the partial derivative of any node and change values. Built mostly as a learning exercise.
  - **_cnn_** (C)
    CNN is a straightforward implementation of a Neural Network from scratch in C as a single file header library. It comes with 3 example datasets: logic gates, ionosphere data and the MNIST handwritten numeral set.

**Demonstration Programs** <br>
  - **_IO_uring_**
    This is a simple demonstration program that shows how to take advantage of this very fast way of making IO kernal requests
  - **_wasm_test_**
    This shows how to build wasm into your website without requiring a complicated toolchain and build process
